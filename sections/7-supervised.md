# Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised machine learning takes places in two steps: the *training* phase, and the *testing* phase.  In the training phase, you use a portion of your data to *train* your algorithm (which, in our case, is a classification algorithm).  You provide both your feature vector and your labels to the algorithm, and the algorithm searches for patterns in your data that can help associate it with a particular label.

In the testing phase, we use the classifier we trained in the previous step, and give it previously unseen feature vectors representing unseen data to the algorithm, and have the algorithm predict the label.  We can then compare the "true" label to the predicted label, and see if our classifier provides us with a good and generalizable way of accomplishing the task (in our case, the task of automatically distinguishing news sentences from romance sentences).

It's important to remember that we cannot use the same data we used to build the classifier to test the data; if we did, our classifier would be 100% correct all of the time!  This will not tell us how our trained classifer will perform on new, unseen data.  We therefore need to split our data into a *train set* and a *test set*.
- We will use the train set data to train our classifier
- We will use the test set data to test our classifier

First, we need to load in the Python libraries that we will be using for our analysis. 


```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import brown
from nltk import pos_tag_sents
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import sklearn
```

## Read data in from a spreadsheet
Let's take the data we just saved out and load it back into a dataframe so that we can do some analysis with it!


```python
df = pd.read_csv("df_news_romance.csv")
```


## Preparing data for machine learning
We're almost ready to do some machine learning!  First, we need to split our data into *feature vectors* and *labels*.  We need them separated to train the classifier.  Remember, the features we are using to train our classifier are numbers of nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are in each sentence.  (We are not using the sentences themselves as features!)


```python
fv = df[["NN", "JJ"]]
fv.head()
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>NN</th>
      <th>JJ</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>




```python
df['label'].value_counts()
```




    news       4623
    romance    4431
    Name: label, dtype: int64



We have more news sentences than romance sentences; this is not a problem, but it's something to take note of during evaluation.


## Partitioning data into train and test sets
When you are partitioning your data into train and test sets, a good place to start is to use 75% of your data for training, and 25% of your data for testing.  We want as much training data as possible, while also having enough testing data to ensure that our trained classifier is generalizable across a number of examples.  This will also lead to more accurate evalutation of our trained classifier.

Fortunately, sklearn has a function that will do exactly this!


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(fv, df['label'],
                                                stratify=df['label'], 
                                                test_size=0.25,
                                                   random_state = 42)
```

- We use the "stratify" argument because we have an uneven amount of training data; we have more news sentances than romance sentences.  By using stratify, we ensure that our classifier will take this data imbalence into account.


- In this example, we are using a fixed random state, to ensure we will always get exactly the same value when we classify.  Adding this argument is unnecessary for most types of classification; we do it here to ensure our results do not vary slightly across runs.


```python
print(X_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
```

    (6790, 3)
    (2264, 3)
    

## What classifier do I use?
Chosing a classifier can be a challenging task.  However, this flowchart can give you an idea of where to start!

According to this, we are going to use LinearSVC, which is a linear model for classification that separates classes using a line, a plane, or a hyperplane. SVC stands for "Support Vector Classifier", which is a type of support vector machine algorithm.
